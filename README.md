# My Personal Portfolio (WIP)

This is my personal portfolio website. It is built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Vite](https://vite.dev/).

Animation is powered by [anime.js](https://animejs.com/).

## Tools used to build this project

This website was built using a combination of manually written code in [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) and using [Opencode](https://opencode.ai/) with Claude Sonnet 4.5.
